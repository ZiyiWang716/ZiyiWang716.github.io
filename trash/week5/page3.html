      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhat I like this project most is how it brings me a feeling of both "estrangement" and "connection" 
      when we interact with the web. When I answer those questions, I am following the narrative of this 
      net artwork instead of our daily language. All the irrgular-shaped props and those unicodes 
      give us a new version of how our mood and status could be interpreted and represented different from our used ways. With the  
      different filters generated and the unicode texts on the photo, 
      the viewer- which could be my friends or followers on instagram- are left with the question:" What Is She Saying?"
