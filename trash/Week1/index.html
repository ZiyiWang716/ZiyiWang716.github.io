    <P>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn John Berger's <cite>Ways of Seeing</cite>, Berger brought up the idea of 
    how women were oftend depicted as nude to feed an appetite of their male 
spectators. The very same idea is portrayed in the painting <cite>Phryne 
    before the Areopagus</cite> by French artist Jean-Léon Gérôme. 
    The subject matter is Phryne, a legendary courtesan in ancient Greece who 
    was put on trial for impiety. Phryne was acquitted after her defender 
    Hypereides removed her robe and exposed her naked bosom, 
    "to excite the pity of her judges by the sight of her beauty." The woman depicted is 
weak, solidary, and submissive in the scene, satisfying the men's complacency 
of their dominace over the women.</P>
<br>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo here, I changed the story by 
    switching the positions of the male and female figures. The man is now judged 
    by his nudity and the women become sitting at the seats. 
    However, the female judges do not even want to get a look at the 
    body of the man. They are given the power to judge, but they just do not have 
    an interest to do so.
