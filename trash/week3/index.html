                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTim Berners-Lee, the inventor of Word Wide Web, talked about his opinion about our 
                contemporary web life in his article Long Live The Web. And yes, Web has made our 
                life so different from the past by spreading information universally to people 
                around the world. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHowever, with its huge development within just about 
                two decades, Web is becoming more and more like a double-edged sword. While its powerfulness has
                 greatly benefited each of us, it is also at the same time being malevolently 
                 used by a group of Web users who only consider their own interests. Here, I list a few 
                  <strong>crises </strong>
                  our Web is facing nowadays that are most common. Hope we all can 
                  make an effort to eliminate these dangers so that we can have a better 
                  wordwide virtual community in the near future! <br><br>
