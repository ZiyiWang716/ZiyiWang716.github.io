        <h2 class="subtitle">App Introcudtion</h2>
        <p class="body-text">Coursera is an online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere, 
            access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies. Founded in 2012,
            Coursera has gained huge success with over 90 million registered users from over 200 countries. 
            The average rating of course on Coursera is 4.7 out of 5 and 93% of Coursera learners say they 
            would recommend the platform to their friends.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Probelm</h2>
        <p class="body-text">
            With more and more people having easy access to internet, online learning has become a popular 
            tool for people to reach their academic and career goals. Moreover, since pandemic, Coursera has seen a 450% 
            increase in the number of enrollments in 2020 and the trend of virtual learning continues 
            to grow in nowadays. However, among the 92 million students in Coursera, only 20% of them
             use mobile only and the majority of them has expressed that they have a much more good experience accessing Coursera 
             through website than native app. while increasingly more people take advantage of their mobile phones and want to study 
             on their phones utilizing the fragmented time during the day, Coursera would definitely serve their users 
             better if they could improve their mobile app version.

        <h3 class="subsubtitle"> App Reviews</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
            I looked the reviews of Coursera on Google Play Store which had 130K+ reviews and 
            identified some pain points of the users:

        <h3 class="subsubtitle"> Usability Testing</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
            To get a better understanding of user behaviors, I conducted one-to-one usability test 
            with 3 people who had known and registered for Coursera before but did not end up using it for some 
            reasons. I hoped that by observing the using experience of these "disappointed users", 
            I would be able to find some insights of how to improve the app.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Ideation</h2>
        <h3 class="subsubtitle">Affinity Mapping</h3>
        <p class="body-text">After the research stage, I compiled all the pain points identified 
            and grouped similar ones. At last, the pain points were grouped into two groups of experience, 
            one related to <span style="font-weight: bolder">course finding</span> and the other about 
            <span style="font-weight: bolder">course taking</span>. Within the two 
    groups, pain points were further divided into subsections containing different app pages. 
    This mapping gave me a clear structure of what to improve and redesign in order to benefit users.</p>

        <h3 class="subsubtitle">Card Sorting</h3>
        <p class="body-text">Since Explore is the place that users browse to find the course they want, 
            the app could only achieve its success by capturing its users' taste. Therefore, I asked 
            8 participants to do a card sorting on how they would prioritize different categories of 
            courses suggested on the Explore page and redesign the Explore page based on their preferences.

            <h3 class="subsubtitle">Button Testing</h3>
            <p class="body-text">In the research stage, many users had expressed their confusions
            with the words Coursera had used. Therefore, to give the users a better experience enrolling 
            courses, I decided to do a button testing for the CTA buttons in the course 
            enroll page with some users so that confusions and mistakes could be avoided in the redesign.
