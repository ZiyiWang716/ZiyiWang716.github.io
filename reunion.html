        <h2 class="subtitle">Problem</h2>
        <p class="body-text">Finding a perfect match to date is tough as it is, but 
            finding time to meet available and interesting people as a 
            single parent is nearly impossible. Moreover, for single parents, they date with 
        more concerns than the younger population, thinking of their kids, busy work, and 
    more. </p>

                with the ones he or she is interested and wants to know more. The chat could only start when 
                both sides are willing to know each other more. Therefore, when one user send a hello mesage 
                to another user, there will be a text box showing the request from that user and the user 
                received the request could either accept it or decline it.
            </li>
            <li>To make things easier, the user could directly make a phone call or 
                send a dating invitation to the other specifying details like location and time.
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bolder">Date</span> page will list all the coming dates

        <h2 class="subtitle">Feedback & Future Improvement</h2>
        <ul class="article-ul" >
            <li>Registraion pages are too overwhelming. The process should be further divided 
                into different pages. </li>
            <li>Event page should be better utilized and more ineractive.</li>
            <li>Possible preview browsing opportunity before registration should be given to get potential users onboard.</li>
            <li>The experience could be overwhelming if the user is receiving too many requests from others. 
                One possible solution could be to reduce amount of requests for the user by reserving
                 good matches.
            </li>
            <li>The networking among users should be carefully considered. For example, since the users
                can see who else is also attending an event, how users might feel if they have 
                multiple matches show up to the same event? This could potentially lead to a negative 
                and/or awkward experience if it's not handled with care.
