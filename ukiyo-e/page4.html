  <p id="text1">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNot only Japanese artists depicted Ukiyo-e. Many foreign artists 
      were also fascinated by Ukiyo-e. The painting on the left was created by 
    Paul Jacoulet (1896–1960), a French, 
    Japan-based woodblock print artist known for a 
    style that mixed the traditional ukiyo-e style and 
    techniques developed by the artist himself.

  <p id="text2">As the interpretation suggest, Ukiyo-e stands for "the 
      pictures of the floating world. The style of Ukiyo-e with its delicate lines 
      is perfect for subjects Japanese literature, 
      art history, religion, and mythology. And it is often to see how even Eastern culture
       and mythology can be well incorporated into a Ukiyo-e painting.

  <p id="text3">Yūrei-zu are also a famous genre that portray images of ghosts, demons 
      and other supernatural beings. They are considered to be a 
      subgenre of fūzokuga, "pictures of manners and customs."
      These types of art works reached the peak of their popularity 
      in Japan in the mid- to late 19th century. And this style has also influenced
     the Japanese horro comics which are very famous until now.</p>
  <p id="text4">Animals are also a commonn actegory for the paintings and prints and 
      they often come with some metaphors with Japanese traditional culture. 
      Intrestingly, they are sometimes delineated with human features in a very lovely way.
