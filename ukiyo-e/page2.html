  <p >&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLandscapes were a beloved genre of woodblock prints.
    Japanese people had a deep spiritual love and respect for nature, 
    relishing in its beauty. Waterfalls, for instance, were believed 
    to be sacred within the animistic values of the Shinto religion, 
    and were a frequent pilgrimage and subject matter in ukiyo-e. 
    Mount Fuji was another popular character for ukiyo-e, due to its 
    cultural and religious significance, as it was believed to be the 
    source for immortality.
